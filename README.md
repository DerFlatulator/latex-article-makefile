LaTeX with Bibtex makefile with wordcount support.

Simple Makefile for building LaTeX documents which include bibtex references and require a word count.

Word counts can be included directly into documents with `\include{wordcount}`.

Be sure to enter in your main `.tex` and `.aux` files correctly.
